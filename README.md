Small script I made for myself that runs intel undervolt, tlp and powertop.

I have these in a script instead of having each automatically run on boot so that it is easy for me to enable/disable them if needed.
My system sometimes freezes up if intel undervolt starts on boot so that is another reason I have the program running here instead of automatically on boot.
